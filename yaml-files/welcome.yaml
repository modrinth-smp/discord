            Modrinth SMP serves as the unofficial SMP experience for Modrinth, made for and by community members! This project is not at all
            affiliated with Modrinth, but members of the Modrinth team may still play on the server and talk with the community here.

            - name: 1. No hacking.

            - name: 2. Punishment evasion.
              value: "Punishment evasion (attempting to evade punishment for breaking the rules) will be met with a permanent ban."

            - name: 3. Don't exploit accessibility tools/bots.
              value: "Exploiting or misusing these tools, such as using PluralKit for roleplaying, will be met with appropriate punishment."
